Why use the 12-factor support?
==============================

The native support for web applications in Rockcraft and Charmcraft provides
a streamlined approach for deploying and integrating your application into the
Juju ecosystem. It's possible to build a rock and charm from scratch for your
web application, but this approach comes with a high learning curve.

The main advantages of the support are as follows:

* You're not locked into a closed-source or paid system -- Rockcraft, Charmcraft,
  and Juju are all open-source.
* You don't need a lot of product expertise to get started -- with only a few
  commands, you can fully set up a Kubernetes environment for your web application without
  needing to build the rock or charm from scratch.
* By using the native support, your application comes out of the box with built-in integrations
  with observability, ingress, databases, and much more, saving you time and effort from
  setting them up yourself.
* The 12-factor tooling is updated with the latest Juju and Rockcraft features and
  best practices. By using the tooling, you're guaranteed to follow best practices while
  taking advantage of all the most up-to-date features available.
