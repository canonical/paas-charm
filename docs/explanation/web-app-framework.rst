Web app framework
=================

The 12-Factor app support in Charmcraft and Rockcraft is opinionated by design.
That way, if your application is writen with one of the supported frameworks
and follows the conventions, the 12-Factor project will be able to create
automatically a software operator for it.


The following frameworks are supported:

- `Flask <https://canonical-charmcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/extensions/flask-framework-extension/>`_
- `Django <https://canonical-charmcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/extensions/django-framework-extension/>`_
- `FastAPI <https://canonical-charmcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/extensions/fastapi-framework-extension/>`_
- `Go <https://canonical-charmcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/extensions/go-framework-extension/>`_
- `Express.js <https://canonical-charmcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/extensions/express-framework-extension/>`_
- Spring Boot (pending)
