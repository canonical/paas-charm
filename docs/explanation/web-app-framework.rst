Web app framework
=================

The 12-Factor app support in Charmcraft and Rockcraft is opinionated by design.
That way, if your application is written with one of the supported frameworks
and follows the conventions, the 12-Factor project will be able to automatically
create a software operator for it.


The following frameworks are supported:

- :ref:`Flask <charmcraft:flask-framework-extension>`
- :ref:`Django <charmcraft:django-framework-extension>`
- :ref:`FastAPI <charmcraft:fastapi-framework-extension>`
- :ref:`Go <charmcraft:go-framework-extension>`
- :ref:`Express.js <charmcraft:expressjs-framework-extension>`
- :ref:`Spring Boot <charmcraft:spring-boot-framework-extension>`
