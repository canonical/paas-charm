Explanation
===========

The following explanations provide context and clarification on key topics related to the use and
configuration of web app frameworks.

12-factor app principles
------------------------

The glue point of the 12-factor framework support in Rockcraft and Charmcraft is
the `12-factor methodology <https://12factor.net/>`_. The 12-Factor methodology
is a set of best practices for building modern, scalable, and maintainable web
applications. By following these principles, you can easily create a rock
(OCI image) and a charm (software operator) for your web app that can take
advantage of the full Juju ecosystem.

Learn more about the components involved and how the principles are applied in
the following pages:

* :ref:`Juju, charms and rocks <explanation_foundations>`: Descriptions of
  the Canonical products involved. 
* :ref:`How the 12-factor principles are applied in rocks and charms <explanation_12_factor_principles_applied>`: 
  An overview on how the 12-factor methodology is applied to rocks and charms.

12-factor ecosystem
-------------------

The native 12-factor framework support in Rockcraft and Charmcraft provides an
opinionated way to easily integrate your web application into the Juju ecosystem.
The Juju ecosystem provides a multitude of `curated software operators <https://charmhub.io/>`_
for your observability stack, database, SSO, and many more and allows their deployment and
lifecycle management on metal, on VMs, on K8s and on cloud providers
(see `substrates <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/cloud/>`_).

That way, the 12-factor framework support in Rockcraft and Charmcraft offers
a fully fledged Platform as a Service that streamlines managing the
infrastructure, whether on premises or on cloud, at any scale, and allows developers
to focus on their core competences instead of a complex software stack.

  various components come together to form the 12-factor ecosystem.
* :ref:`Web app framework <explanation_web_app_frameworks>`: More details about the
  supported web app frameworks.

12-Factor app charm
-------------------

The software operator built with Charmcraft containerizes the web app workload so that
you can deploy, configure, and integrate your web app in the Juju ecosystem. The following
page provides an overview of the architecture, components, and source code.
