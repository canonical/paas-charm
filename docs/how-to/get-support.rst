How to get support
==================

The Charmcraft documentation contains a
`troubleshooting guide <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/charmcraft/stable/howto/manage-web-app-charms/use-web-app-charm/#troubleshoot-the-charm>`_
with detailed information on accessing logs, viewing the app details,
and checking the Juju container.

If you have questions or need help using the 12-factor app support
in Charmcraft and Rockcraft, please reach out to us on
`Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/#12-factor-charms:ubuntu.com>`_.
It's helpful for us to understand the full context, so when
you describe your issue, include the output of the Juju and Pebble logs.

Please check the `known issues on GitHub <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/issues>`_
to verify if your issue has been previously reported.
