Tutorials
=========

Rockcraft and Charmcraft have comprehensive getting started tutorials teaching
you to containerize a web app into an OCI-compliant image, create a
software operator around the container image, and set up a Kubernetes environment
with ingress and a database. Each tutorial starts with building a basic
"Hello, world" app and ends with either a functional container image (Rockcraft)
or a fully deployed and integrated web app (Charmcraft).
