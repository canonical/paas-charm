Enhanced support for the Spring Boot extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES

The Spring Boot extension now has additional support for
`SMTP <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/101>`_,
`SAML <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/103>`_,
`Redis <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/109>`_,
`S3 <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/110>`_,
`MongoDB <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/111>`_,

`Observability <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/115>`_,
and `RabbitMQ <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/119>`_.

These updates align Spring Boot with the other extensions and provide
out-of-the-box integrations with more charms in the Juju ecosystem.

Improved output in Gunicorn logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've enabled tracing for your web app and you use the 
X-Request-ID header in your response headers, the Gunicorn access logs
will log the X-Request-ID header to identify a request from the client.

Added OIDC support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the extensions now have a predefined integration with OIDC.

Relevant links:

* `OIDC support for Flask <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/122>`_
* `OIDC support for Django <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/124>`_

* `OIDC support for Express <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/137>`_

Updated integration tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The integration tests have been migrated to Jubilant due to the
`deprecation <https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/python-libjuju-3-6-1-3-mind-your-ps-and-qs/18248>`_
of ``python-libjuju``.
Now our integration tests take advantage of enhanced writing and
debugging, and our tests align closer to the Juju CLI experience.
